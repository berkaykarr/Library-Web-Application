Copy the svtProject database(.bak backup file) into  SQL Server using restore procedures.


Open the web application using a visual studio version, preferrably visual studio 2022
press on the solution(WebApplication6.sln) twice to enter the project altogether if you want aswell.
(Make sure you downloaded asp.net web forms in it aswell, cause in visual studio 2022 version especially you have to download it manually).



In the web application, inside the web.config file,
in the connection string, you can keep the server name as "." if its a local host, otherwise you can change it to the server name you desire to host the database on.

THE LOGIN BUTTON DOES NOT REDIRECT TO THE LOGIN PAGE EVEN AFTER I CHANGED IT TO .ASPX INSTEAD OF HTML, SO I RESTORED IT BACK TO HTML
